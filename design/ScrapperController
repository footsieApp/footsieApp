pick websites to scrap, maybe a list predefined to turn on or off or ability to add new websites. Need to decide where this tool/job sits in relation to rest of app; ran from within app? independently to the app DB?

list :
	takes in a list of pairs of URLs and customized scrapper classes
	populates DB with consistent data from each scrapper class
	
heartbeat :
	config for how often/when to hit websites. Whether to ignore robots.txt or not?
